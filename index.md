# Fantasy Football Victory Speech

### Buenos Tardes, losers

I‚Äôve waited almost 14 years for this moment, and you best believe I will be savouring every second of it. Fantasy Football is a game entirely dependent on luck‚Äîexcept if you finish in 1st place. Then it requires skill, effort, and ruthless domination. All of which was on display this season by your champion: *I Read The Book.*

I could point out failed draft picks, like letting the Fantasy RB1 fall to me in the second round. I could mention how much of a stallion Brian Thomas Jr. turned out to be. I could list winning moves like picking Tyrone Tracy Jr. off waivers or how Cameron "Horse Cock" Dicker the Kicker came in clutch during the championship. Or, of course, I could mention Noah offering the worst trades in fantasy history ‚Äî only for me to turn the tables and take George Kittle off his hands for a metaphorical bag of dicks.

But I won‚Äôt mention any of that.

Instead, I would like to thank you all for your generous donations to the *Adam Donen‚Äôs Bank Account Foundation*. Your contributions will go toward a custom championship ring that will be proudly on display at all future fantasy football proceedings.

Secondly, I would be remiss if I didn‚Äôt give thanks to the Fantasy Gods for blessing my season with no injuries, MVP-worthy performances from both Lamar Jackson and Saquon Barkley, and what I can only assume is the highest-scoring finals matchup in league history.

While past victors have generally done a safe and boring approach with their victory speeches, I've decided to flex my generative AI skills and made indivudal raps roasts for each team.

## **Jadon Daniels (2nd Place)**

Let‚Äôs be real ‚Äî it was always going to be us in the finals. Incredible performance this year, an electric matchup, and ultimately, it could have gone either way. But‚Ä¶ it didn‚Äôt. ü´°

## **Chef Wort (3rd Place)**

It was a ok effort, but a team can only be carried by one player for so long. Second year in the league and finishing on the podium is an honourable achievement. ü´°

## **Through the Perilous Fight! (4th Place)**

Your fantasy season was a lot like the Dolphins ‚Äî started off with a lot of promise, only for your stars to disappear when you needed them the most. O'er the ramparts we watched ‚Äî 2025 season will go hard. ü´°

## **Vodcua and Chase (5th Place)**

For a team with so much talent, getting bent over by Josh Allen in the first round would be a lot more upsetting if you weren‚Äôt the defending champion. I thought you had a real shot at going back-to-back, but I will happily take the championship reign off your hands. ü´°

## **And Learn (6th Place)**

Mike Davis can‚Äôt swim, and neither can your fantasy dreams. Ripping off Cundill for Justin Jefferson wasn‚Äôt enough to get you over the hump. I‚Äôll be patiently awaiting my victory funds at **adam.donen11@gmail.com.** ü´°

## **JULIO THINK YOU ARE (7th Place)**

For a guy who hates making trades, I never would‚Äôve guessed you‚Äôd be involved in a collusion scandal that sent shockwaves through this group chat like we‚Äôve never seen. I hate to say it but Julio hasn‚Äôt played a snap in two seasons. It‚Äôs time for a rebuild and rebranding of the fantasy team. ü´°

## **CRASHED Rice (8th Place)**

Your season was derailed faster than Rashee Rice was driving during his car crash. Sincere McCormick at flex in the first round of the playoffs, is all that needs to be said. Thank you for stealing the final playoff spot from an actual contender, and making my road to victory that much easier ü´°

## **JSN Fab (9th Place)**

Third in points, ninth in standings is sad but a first team all pro dovmocracy performance standing up for the integrity of leauge is nothing to be ashamed of. Spend less time studying for useless actuarial exams and more time on whats actually important, fantasy football, and maybe you'll get back to the podium someday. ü´°

## **My Team Sucks (10th Place)**

Another year, another Cundill-led fantasy football disappointment. Another team filled with Panthers and Jags running backs and shitty players on shitty teams. I am placing my futures bet for the 2025 fantasy season - Cundill to think he has a good team and miss the playoffs (+250) ü´°

## **Fifth Win Today (11th Place)**

Another fantasy season at the bottom of the standings. My epic comeback on MNF propelled my squad to domiance but to be perfectly honest, I have not read your fantasy football book but that‚Äôs probably for the best, considering the performances you‚Äôve displayed since writing it. ***15 - 27*** üò¨ The title for the sequel should be *‚ÄúI Don‚Äôt Know Fantasy Football.‚Äù* ü´°

## **Bad Nabers (12th Place)**

First overall pick, last-place finish. The Cleveland Browns of our league. Stoller and Benny Shanks co-led a team to the worst losing streak in league history. Stoller, you have successfully managed to come in last place both times you were part of a co-led team. It‚Äôs time to look in the mirror. ü´°

And so, with my name etched into Avery Cundill league history forever, I will leave you with this: I am the best at fantasy football and you all suck.
