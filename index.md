# Fantasy Football Victory Speech

## Buenos Díaz, losers

I’ve waited almost 14 years for this moment, and you best believe I will be savouring every second of it. Fantasy Football is a game entirely dependent on luck—except if you finish in 1st place. Then it requires skill, effort, and ruthless domination. All of which was on display this season by your champion: *I Read The Book.*

I could point out failed draft picks, like letting the Fantasy RB1 fall to me in the second round. I could mention how much of a stallion Brian Thomas Jr. turned out to be. I could list winning moves like picking Tyrone Tracy Jr. off waivers or how Cameron "Horse Cock" Dicker the Kicker came in clutch during the championship. Or, of course, I could mention Noah offering the worst trades in fantasy history — only for me to turn the tables and take George Kittle off his hands for a metaphorical bag of dicks.

But I won’t mention any of that.

Instead, I would like to thank you all for your generous donations to the **Adam Donen’s Bank Account Foundation**. Your contributions will go toward a custom championship ring that will be proudly on display at all future fantasy football proceedings.

## **Jadon Daniels**

Let’s be real — it was always going to be us in the finals. Incredible performance this year, an electric matchup, and ultimately, it could have gone either way. But… it didn’t. 🫡

## **Chef Wort**

It was a fine effort, but a team can only be carried by one player for so long. Second year in the league and finishing on the podium is an honourable achievement. 🫡

## **Through the Perilous Fight!**

Your fantasy season was a lot like the Dolphins — started off with a lot of promise, only for your stars to disappear when you needed them the most. O'er the ramparts we watched — 2025 season will go hard. 🫡

## **Vodcua and Chase**

For a team with so much talent, getting bent over by Josh Allen in the first round would be a lot more upsetting if you weren’t the defending champion. I thought you had a real shot at going back-to-back, but I will happily take the championship reign off your hands. 🫡

## **And Learn**

Mike Davis can’t swim, and neither can your fantasy dreams. Ripping off Cundill for Justin Jefferson wasn’t enough to get you over the hump. I’ll be patiently awaiting my victory funds at **adam.donen11@gmail.com.** 🫡

## **JULIO THINK YOU ARE**

For a guy who hates making trades, I never would’ve guessed you’d be involved in a collusion scandal that sent shockwaves through this group chat like we’ve never seen. Julio hasn’t played a snap in two seasons. It’s time to change the fantasy team name… and also the strategy. 🫡

## **CRASHED Rice**

Your season was derailed faster than Rashee Rice was driving during his car crash. Sincere McCormick at flex in the first round of the playoffs was never going to get it done, but as a multi-time winner, you’ll get no sympathy from me. 🫡

## **JSN Fab**

Third in points but ninth in standings is insane. As someone who calculates probabilities for a living, not even you could have seen that coming. I appreciate you standing up for the integrity of the league with such ferociousness. 🫡

## **My Team Sucks**

Another year, another Cundill-led fantasy football team filled with subpar Carolina Panthers players and Jags running backs. It’s time to recruit Ruth Ashrafi for some prayer advice because your fantasy team needs divine intervention. 🫡

## **Fifth Win Today**

To be perfectly honest, I have not read your fantasy football book — but that’s probably for the best, considering the performances you’ve displayed since writing it. The title for the sequel should be *“I Don’t Know Fantasy Football.”* 🫡

## **Bad Nabers**

First overall pick, last-place finish. The Cleveland Browns of our league. Stoller and Benny Shanks co-led a team to the worst losing streak in league history. Stoller, you have successfully managed to come in last place both times you were part of a co-led team. It’s time to look in the mirror. 🫡

## Final Thoughts

And so, with my name etched into **Avery Cundill league history**, I will leave you with this: this wasn’t just a victory — it was a masterclass. You weren’t just beaten: you were dominated.

**Draft smarter, spend your FAAB, and pray to the Fantasy Gods I don’t repeat. My ego will be unbearable.**

Until next season, gentlemen:  

**Adam Donen**  
*I Read The Book Manager*  
*2024 Avery Cundill League Champion*
